## Git Procedures
### Work in individual branches
Work should be done in a feature branch and merged into `main`. `main` is branch protected to prevent direct pushes. At least 1 approval is required before `main` can be merged into.
### Branch Naming
Branches should be named as `name/feature` so `dante/improve-data-flow` is a valid branch name.
### It is recommended that commits are signed using GPG to verify authenticity
For tips on creating a GPG key and commit signing, view [this GitHub tutorial](https://docs.github.com/articles/generating-a-gpg-key/).
